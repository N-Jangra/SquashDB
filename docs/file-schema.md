# File / Directory Schema

Two separate things are covered here: (1) the app's own source tree, and (2) the on-device files the app creates for backups (which only exist if a backup folder has been chosen — see [storage.md](storage.md)).

```

Every `.html` page is a standalone document (no client-side router/SPA framework) that loads `applock.js`, then `metadata.js`, then `app.js`, in that order — the lock-gate code must be available before `app.js`'s own init runs. Each page calls `initializePage()` on `DOMContentLoaded`, which detects the current page by checking for known container IDs (`getCurrentPageTab()`) and re-renders only what that page needs; shared state is reloaded from `localStorage` fresh on every navigation. If an app-lock method is set and the current session hasn't been unlocked, `guardAppLock()` intercepts before any of that runs and shows the lock overlay instead — see [app-lock.md](app-lock.md).

## Launcher icon variants

12 total, all crossed with the same 16 app-name choices (192 `activity-alias` entries): **Classic** (default base `<application>` icon, plain flat art — no source SVG, just the original mipmap set), **Turquoise** (current default-enabled alias), **Orange**, **Pink** (flat solid-color recolors of Classic), and 8 illustrated variants generated from the SVGs in `www/icons/`: **Bento Grid**, **Glass Impact**, **Play Stack**, **Progress Ring**, **Vault**, **Orbit Hub**, **Progress Vault**, **Timeline Pulse**.

A **Purple** variant and an "invisible"/blank-icon option existed at one point (the invisible one used a plain opaque white fill, since fully-transparent icons render as a solid black fallback tile on many launchers) — both were removed; if you see references to them in old notes/commits, they no longer exist in the manifest, string resources, or icon picker.

## Native plugin surface

`AppIconPlugin` (`@CapacitorPlugin(name = "AppIcon")`):
| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `setLook({icon, nameIndex})` | Enables exactly one `Look_<icon>_<nameIndex>` activity-alias, disables all others |
| `getLook()` | Reports which alias is currently enabled |

`BackupFolderPlugin` (`@CapacitorPlugin(name = "BackupFolder")`):
| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pickFolder()` | Launches the SAF `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` picker, persists write access |
| `hasPersistedFolder({uri})` | Checks whether a previously granted URI is still valid |
| `writeFile({uri, fileName, content})` | Writes a flat text file directly under the tree root |
| `readFile({uri})` | Reads a file's text content (UTF-8 decoded) by its own document URI |
| `readBinaryFile({uri})` | Reads a file's raw bytes as base64 — safe for binary formats (e.g. `.tar`), unlike `readFile`'s UTF-8 decoding |
| `listFiles({uri})` | Lists immediate children of a folder as `{name, uri}` pairs |
| `deleteFile({uri})` | Deletes a single file by its own document URI (used only for rotating old auto-backups — never called on a folder) |
| `writeNestedFile({uri, dirPath, fileName, content})` | Get-or-create every folder in `dirPath`, then write a text file |
| `writeNestedBinaryFile({uri, dirPath, fileName, base64Content})` | Same, but decodes base64 and writes raw bytes (used for thumbnails) |
| `exportTarArchive({uri, sourceDirPath, tarFileName, extraJsonFileName?, extraJsonContent?})` | Recursively walks `sourceDirPath`, writes a POSIX (ustar) tar to a sibling file, optionally injecting one extra top-level JSON entry |

Both are Java, registered in `MainActivity.onCreate()` via `registerPlugin(...)`, and called from JS as `window.Capacitor.Plugins.<Name>.<method>(...)`.

## On-device backup files (Android, real filesystem)

These only exist once a backup folder has been picked (via Backups & Restore → Change Backup Folder, or on first Export/Sync). Nothing is created automatically before that.

                                        entry squashdb_backup_<YYYY-MM-DD>.json (the same
                                        payload buildBackupPayload() produces for a plain
                                        JSON export)
```

Notes:
- The mirror under `squash-db/` is **additive-only** — items deleted or recategorized in-app leave their old folder behind; nothing here is ever auto-deleted.
- `.tar` uses no compression (plain POSIX ustar) — written and read by hand-rolled code in `BackupFolderPlugin.java`/`app.js` (`parseTarArchive()`), not a library.
- On non-native platforms (plain desktop browser), Export instead uses `showSaveFilePicker()` if available, or falls back to a plain `<a download>` link — no `squash-db/` tree is ever created outside the native Android path.
- On a **fresh install** with an empty item list, picking a backup folder that already has a `squash-db/` tree or a `squashdb_backup_*.tar`/`.json` file in it triggers an offer to auto-restore from the newest one found — see [storage.md](storage.md).

See [storage.md](storage.md) for how/when these files actually get written (sync triggers, delay setting, what's cache vs. persistent), and [metadata.md](metadata.md) for what populates `thumbnail`/the metadata-sources file. Note that `appLock` (PIN/pattern/password hashes, security questions) is **not** included in this mirror — only `metadataSources` is currently written to `squash-db/settings/`; app-lock data only ever lives in `localStorage` and in a full `.tar`/`.json` backup export (see [app-lock.md](app-lock.md)).
