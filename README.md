# SquashDB

A watchlist and media progress tracker for games, movies, TV series, anime, manga, and novels — packaged as an Android app with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).

## Features

- Track progress per category (episodes/seasons, chapters/volumes, playtime) with custom statuses per list
- Create your own tracking lists in addition to the built-in categories, and enable/disable or reorder them
- Dashboard, timeline (completion history), and stats views
- Optional online metadata lookup (TVmaze, Wikidata, Open Library) for thumbnails, runtimes, and episode counts
- Customizable bottom navigation icons
- Switchable app icon and app name (Android home screen), each with several presets
- Local JSON export/import for backups
- Light/dark themes with multiple accent colors

## Development

Requires Node.js and the Android SDK.

```
npm install
npx cap sync android
```

Edit files under `www/`, then re-run `npx cap sync android` to copy changes into the native project.

### Building the APK

Open `android/` in Android Studio, or build from the command line:

```
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is output to `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

#### One-shot build with `compile_apk.py`

`compile_apk.py` is a self-contained build script that doesn't rely on any pre-installed Node, JDK, or Android SDK — it downloads and sets all of them up locally under `build_env/` (safe to delete afterward), then runs the full build.

```
python3 compile_apk.py --version 1.2.3
```

What it does, in order:

1. Downloads Node.js, a JDK, and the Android command-line tools into `build_env/` (skipped if already present)
2. Installs the required Android SDK platform and build-tools via `sdkmanager`
3. Updates `versionName` and `versionCode` in `android/app/build.gradle` from `--version` (e.g. `1.2.3` → versionCode `10203`)
4. Runs `npm install` and `npx cap sync`
5. Runs `./gradlew assembleDebug`
6. Copies the resulting APK to the project root as `SquashDB-<version>.apk`

`--version` defaults to `1.0` if omitted.
